# ArchiNext Website

This website was created as a personal project that I used to get some practical experience using Sass. I found a free website layout on UpLabs (https://www.uplabs.com/posts/archi-next-website) and tried to create the code to replicate the design.

The project is not finished yet. There are some bugs to be fixed and the code to make the website responsive was not implemented.

If you want to see the current state of the website running, plese visit my CodePen profile at: https://codepen.io/RafAmorim/ or go to the project directly at: https://codepen.io/RafAmorim/pen/oKGPPW.
